My first android application.
Also my first time with Java, XML, SQLite.
A simple quiz app just to get my feet wet with Java and help a friend out.
Just the Java is shown, layout XML is ignored.

Important points:
	Relative Layouts
	Buttons
	Scroll Views
	Listeners
	Database operations
	Classes in Java
	Encapsulation
	
Update the database in app/src/main/assets in order to change the questions
